Network Packet Capture and Protocol Analysis using Wireshark

In this task, I used Wireshark to capture and analyze live network packets.
The goal was to observe real-time network traffic and identify different communication protocols.
After installing Wireshark, I started capturing packets on my active Wi-Fi interface.
To generate traffic, I browsed websites and executed the command ping 8.8.8.8 (Googleâ€™s public DNS server).
Wireshark captured packets for various protocols such as ICMP, DNS, and HTTP/TCP.
Using filters like icmp, dns, and http, I analyzed how each protocol functions in the network.
The captured packets were saved in a .pcap file for documentation and further analysis.
Through this experiment, I learned how data flows between source and destination systems.
It also provided hands-on experience with packet analysis, protocol identification, and basic network troubleshooting.
